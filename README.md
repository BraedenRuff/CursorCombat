In the digital realm of Cubeville, a longstanding war is ongoing as the Triangles, continue their relentless
assault. Triangles are aggressive savages, as one would expect without dignified corners, and they are
bent on trying to expand their cult. The Square Council, in a desperate bid to save their citizens and
restore peace, activates the ancient magic of cursor technology.
As the operator of this technology, you become Cubeville's last line of defense against the triangle
invasion, tasked with the mission to neutralize the threat without harming your square brethren.
Avoid your fellow square citizens and your architecture, and kill by mousing over the triangles.

Shape types:
Squares -> Friendly citizen. Don’t touch them with your deadly magic!

Area -> this is a recharge station. Come here before that bar on the bottom left of your screen runs out
